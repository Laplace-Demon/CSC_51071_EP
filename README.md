Assignments realized for course CSC_51071_EP - Distributed data structures, with a soptlight on blockchains (Structures des données distribuées, avec un focus sur les blockchains)

## TD1:

- Implementation of abstract data structure queue, stack and set, to be used in sequential execution and in distributed scenotio
- Generation of concurrent history and experiments to compare with Java's implementation of locked set

## TD2:

- Implementation of various synchronization schemes on linked list (coarse-grained, fine-grained, optimized and lazy)
- Identification of linearizability and linearization policies of variants of these algorithms
